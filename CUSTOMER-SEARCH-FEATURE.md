## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Search Algorithm

```javascript
// Backend search query
.or(`full_name.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,ph_number.ilike.%${searchTerm}%`)
.not('ph_number', 'is', null)
.limit(10)
.order('full_name');
```

### Customer Linking Logic

```javascript
// Frontend payload
const payload = {
  businessId: business.id,
  customerName: selectedCustomer
    ? selectedCustomer.display_text
    : customerName.trim(),
  customerUserId: selectedCustomer ? selectedCustomer.id : null, // Link if selected
  amount: numAmount,
  description: description.trim() || undefined,
};
```

### Enhanced Loan Retrieval

```javascript
// Backend query now includes direct customer lookup
.or(`customer_user_id.eq.${userId},customer_name.ilike.%${userDetails.full_name}%,customer_name.ilike.%${userDetails.ph_number}%`)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface

### Search Input States

1. **Empty State**: "Type to search by name or phone number..."
2. **Searching State**: Shows spinner, "Loading..."
3. **Results State**: Dropdown with user list
4. **Selected State**: Green background, checkmark, selected user info
5. **No Results State**: "No users found. You can still add this customer manually."
