##  Key Features

###  Digital Mutual Agreement System
Every transaction in HisabKitab is recorded only after mutual acknowledgment by both the **lender** and the **receiver**, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy record-keeping system. This includes:

- Lending and borrowing entries
- Approval from both parties
- Return confirmation and verification
- Offline mode service

##  Group Expense Tracking & Settlement

One of HisabKitab’s standout features is the **Group Mode**, which allows users to collaborate and manage shared expenses effectively.

###  Group Records:
- Users can create groups for shared events (e.g., trips, dinners, group purchases)
- Each entry logs:
  - Who paid
  - The amount
  - Remarks
  - Selected members to include in the split


###  Settlement Phase:
Once group expenses are logged, the group can enter a **settlement phase**, where the system:
- Calculates what each member owes others
- Uses **smart optimization** to minimize the number of repayment transactions
- Provides a simple overview of who pays whom

This streamlines and simplifies what is often a chaotic group settlement process.

##  Business Mode

For small business use cases, HisabKitab supports a **Shared Transaction Ledger**, where:
- Multiple accounts can collaboratively manage a single business record
- All parties can view and add entries
- Perfect for partners, small vendors, or shopkeepers tracking daily credits and payments

##  Reminder System

Never miss a repayment or follow-up again. HisabKitab includes:
- Automatic reminder notifications at **5 days**, **1 day**, and **on the deadline** of the repayment period
- **Manual reminder** feature: Lenders can send push/email reminders to receivers with one click
